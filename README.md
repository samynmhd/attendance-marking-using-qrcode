# Attendance Marking using QRCode

A project that i created for my finlay year. Using QRCode as a medium to mark attendance of a classroom. Students use their smart devices to scan the QRCode and mark their precense.

There were few hickups while coding the application.

The intial project was coded fully in NodeJs. I didn't give much thought on the frontend when i started the project. It was all about testing if it was possible to create such a system.

There will be two folders inside. Backend and Client.

All the modules has to be installed before the application can be used.

### Installing and running

Click on the Backend folder and install all the moduels using npm install.

Next do the same for the client folder.

To run the backend npm start bin/www.
`````````````````````````````````````
`````````````````````````````````````
To run the client side npm serve.

For the database(MongoDB), you can create a database link using MLAB and connect to the cloud or use local database.

Adjust the enivronment variables according to your system, so that frontend can communicate with the backend.
